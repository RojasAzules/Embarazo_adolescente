# Teenage pregnancy and conservative politics

What happens when a political party with conservative policies regarding reproductive health wins an election? Could it be that the way in which these people interpret public sexual and reproductive health policies have an observable effect? An evaluation of the possible effect of the transition of the City Council from a municipality to a conservative party is thus presented.

Using a Regression Discontinuity design and information on the population of the Mexican territory from 1985 to 2021 for the adolescent fertility rate, and from 2008 to 2021 for the rate of use of obstetric health services by adolescent women, a robust zero is identified in the causality of these two rates with the electoral transition to a conservative party.
